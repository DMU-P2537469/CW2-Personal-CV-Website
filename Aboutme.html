                        <h3>Childhood</h3>
                        <p>I was born in the UK and left the country when I hit the age of 2. My family moved to a country called Oman, this country would be where I spent my entire upbringing. I went to an international school in which I made friends from each corner of the world. Oman is located within the middle east close to Dubai and is known for its beaches/quiet lifestyle. The school I went to was an IB school in which I can happily say I had obtained my diploma. After graduating from high school I moved to the UK where I enrolled in DMU.</p>

                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>My favorite hobby and passion are competitive video games. I love participating in and watching tournaments surrounding my favorite games. In high school, I was an extremely active person and played a variety of sports: Football, Basketball, Athletics, and Baseball. If I am not playing video games or sports I am most likely relaxing watching Twitch.tv or Youtube.</p>
