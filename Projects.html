                    <p>Video Cave VFX was created during my second year at De Montfort University. The purpose of this website/blog was to educate those interested in getting started within the world of VFX.

                    <p>This project was part of my social media course at De Montfort University. Our task was to reach out to an organization and provide social media support throughout a set time period. I had chosen to work with an animal shelter and assist in the promotion of a gift shop. Apart from the gift shop, I had created promotional footage for the charity to release as well as a series on all social media platforms showcasing specific rescued animals the organization had fostered and given a better life.</p>
